    # Descripton : Count data can sometimes be affected by noise like measurement errors.

def question10_2():
    answer: python bool (True)
    # Description : The value of correlation coefficient ranges from -1 (Perfect negative correlation) to 1 (Perfect positive correlation).
    return answer

def question10_3():
    answer: python bool (True)
    # Description : Sampling is a simpler process becuase aggregation may involve complex calculations.
    return answer

def question10_4():
    answer: python bool (True)
    # Description : Sometimes noise and outliers can be the same, especially when an outlier behaves like noise and is changing the results significantly.

def question10_5():
    answer: python bool (False)
    # Description : Not every case of outlier can be a noise, because some outliers might be valid.

def question10_6():
    answer: python bool (False)
    # Description : Not every binary attribute can be an assymetric binary attribute because sometimes 0 or 1 can be given equal importance. 
    return answer

def question10_7():
    answer: python bool (False)
    # Description : The objects might not be identical, because their magnitudes might be different and cosine similarity doesn't account for that.

def question10_8():
    answer: python bool (False)
    # Description : Discrete variables can be sometimes ratio. Like the number of cars in a parking lot (it can never be infinite)

def question10_9():
    answer: python bool (False)
    # Description : Quantitative variables can be discrete too.
